## <span style="color: pink;">_**Blockquotes**_</span>  
I read this interesting quote the other day:

> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"


>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.

>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

## <span style="color: pink;">_**Paragraphs**_</span>  
We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

## <span style="color: pink;">_**Scribe**_</span>   
  >_"Scribe is a markup language and word processing system that pioneered   
the use of descriptive markup. Scribe was revolutionary when it was proposed,     
because it involved for the first time a clean separation of presentation and content.  
Scribe was designed and developed by Brian Reid of Carnegie Mellon University.  
It formed the subject of his 1980 doctoral dissertation, for which he received  
the Association for Computing Machinery's Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1982."_   

## <span style="color: pink;">_**Generalized Markup Language (GML)**_</span>  
  >_"GML was developed in 1969 and the early 1970s by Charles Goldfarb, Edward Mosher  
and Raymond Lorie (whose surname initials were used by Goldfarb to make up the term GML).  
Using GML, a document is marked up with tags that define what the text is, in terms of  
paragraphs, headers, lists, tables, and so forth. The document can then be automatically  
formatted for various devices simply by specifying a profile for the device. For example,  
it is possible to format a document for a laser printer or a line (dot matrix) printer or  
for a screen simply by specifying a profile for the device without changing the document itself."_
